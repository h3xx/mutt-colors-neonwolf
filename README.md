This is a high-contrast, dark colorscheme for mutt that was inspired by the badwolf series of color schemes.

## Installation

Include `mutt-colors-neonwolf-256.muttrc` as part of your `~/.mutt/muttrc` file.

    $ mkdir -p ~/.mutt
    $ cd ~/.mutt
    $ git clone https://github.com/h3xx/mutt-colors-neonwolf.git mutt-colors-neonwolf
    $ echo 'source ~/.mutt/mutt-colors-neonwolf/mutt-colors-neonwolf-256.muttrc' >>~/.mutt/muttrc

If you keep your muttrc file in `~/.muttrc` then change the last step to:

    $ echo 'source ~/.mutt/mutt-colors-neonwolf/mutt-colors-neonwolf-256.muttrc' >>~/.muttrc
