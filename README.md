## Installation

Include it as part of your `~/.mutt/muttrc` file.

    $ mkdir -p ~/.mutt
    $ cp mutt-colors-neonwolf-256.muttrc ~/.mutt
    $ echo 'source ~/.mutt/mutt-colors-neonwolf-256.muttrc' >>~/.mutt/muttrc

Or if you're particularly lazy:

    $ cat mutt-colors-neonwolf-256.muttrc >>~/.mutt/muttrc
